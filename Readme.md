# 📊 Performance Metrics Tracker

This repository implements a performance metrics tracking module for web applications, utilizing key metrics such as:

- 🌐 **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**
- 🖼️ **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**
- ⏱️ **First Input Delay (FID)**
- 🏞️ **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**
- 🚀 **Time to First Byte (TTFB)**

The module leverages **PerformanceObserver** to monitor and report these metrics, enhancing user experience and optimizing application performance. ✨
